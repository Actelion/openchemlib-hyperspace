First Steps with openchemlib-hyperspace

1. Download and build with maven, i.e. just use "mvn package", or alternatively import into Intellij and execute the maven task "mvn package"

2. The jar file that contains everything that we need is the openchemlib-hyperspace-cli/target/openchemlib-hyperspace-cli.jar , check that it exists

2. Switch to example subfolder and copy the openchemlib-hyperspace-cli.jar file in there

3. Create hyperspace data file from example space file "idorsia_toy_space_a.txt". This is a virtual library that we used for validation of the algorithms. It contains a few synthon reactions and in total around 30k structures, i.e. it is easily possible to compare search results of Hyperspace against normal enumerated search.

To do this use the following command:

java -jar openchemlib-hyperspace-cli.jar CREATESPACE idorsia_toy_space_a.txt test FragFp 2

Explanation of the parameters after CREATESPACE: 1. input file name 2. name of the space that you want to create (determines the output file name) 3. descriptor name (must be FragFp for substructure search), 4. number of threads for space creation. 

4. Start the GUI for interactive search in our toy space

java -jar openchemlib-hyperspace-cli.jar GUI hyperspace_test_config.json

5. Try out some queries using OpenChemLib query features, e.g. "foA@@@DjU_YVgKNBBJ@@@@vpA``"
